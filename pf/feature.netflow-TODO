To implement before considering feature done:

- IP filters should support dash ie: 192.168.1-128.*
- Integrate pfnetflowd as a pf service (start with pf, etc.)
- Present pfnetflowd's running status under Web admin's Admin tab
x Package Net::Flow ourselves (its not in rpmforge) and add as a dep into spec
- Basic tests
- Performance testing (based on expected flow traffic)
- Under load it should react as snort: do what it can up to maxing one core, discard to stay current, not queue
- Provide UI to edit conf/netflow.conf
- Finish the reload_sighandler portion so we can reload the config without a full stop / start cycle
- Strict validation of conf file on loading (if validation doesn't pass, don't reload)

Before merge in trunk:
- Re-assess all TODO, FIXME and XXX tasks

Lab Testing required:
- Multiple flow sources, what will happen with the templates (incl. learned ones)?
- So far, flows gathered by the router in the lab are all LAN to WAN which is very convenient. 
  However, I suspect that they could be in the other direction too. It should be explicitly 
  tested. Do we need another ingress statement on the outgoing interface or not?
  
Future
- Package a seperate netflow/ipfix processor (the bin/ and related libs)
