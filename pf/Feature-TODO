DONE: - Pragmatically test for memory leaks (since we can't realistically check all the code, modules)

DONE: - fully test and rubberstamp freeradius2 support (do wired 802.1x, wireless-802.1x and MAB)
- our rpm package will depend on freeradius2 (and its -perl)
-- modify install doc
- package will install rlm_perl_packetfence in /etc/raddb/? (how?)
- package will modify the config to activate the module and eap, etc.

- rename all node fields in ui.conf to point out that switch, port, voip andd connection_type are Last seen values
- rename all node vlan fields in ui.conf to point out the fact that VLAN is "My VLAN" and hide from node view by default

- Upgrade rlm_perl_packetfence_sql.pl to use new database (not so sure anymore..)
- What can we do that is better than returning -1 to a radius client?
- We'll have to think about how to close locationlog entries for radius authorize requests.. (after a day?)

- If we are in MAB or wired 802.1x do we still get traps? If so, we must find a way to ignore them I guess?
- think about easy guest support wired / wireless and pick between, etc

- create a connection type chart like the OS one

File bug once merged

Tests
- switch in mode registration, MAB and 802.1x should not interfere with VLAN already set in config
- test the RLM_MODULE_USERLOCK return if user must be kicked out (does this work?)
- Don't act on trap answer: what happens?
- Switch doesn't exist in switches.conf: what happens?
test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with a string 
test pfcmd_vlan setAllVlan with a string
test pfcmd_vlan setDefaultVlan
test pfcmd_vlan isolate
DONE: test pfcmd_vlan setVlan with -vlan AND -vlanName (expect error)
DONE: test pfcmd_vlan setVlan without -vlan nor -vlanName (expect error)
DONE: add tests to setVlanByName and test error conditions
on parse config bail if a vlan in switches.conf is not numeric (unless if empty)
worried about SOAP::Lite client thread safety, need to do extensive testing on rlm_perl_packetfence (might have to surround the whole SOAP thing with an eval which would be dirty dirty)
Performance testing with radclient / radtest (simulate a lot of radius clients)
- Test a setup with a Cisco Voice VLAN (stimulate the getVoiceVlan code path)

- Adjust minimum memory requirements for our PacketFence-ZEN virtual machine (because of mod_perl's memory footprint)
- Update NEWS and UPGRADE on feature merge

FUTURE
- consider renaming locationlog to connectionlog

NEWS
- pfcmd_vlan now allows you to specify -vlanName for -setVlan and -setAllVlan (where vlan name is the same as what is defined in switches.conf)

UPGRADE
- bin/pfcmd output changed (bin/pfcmd locationhistorymac, bin/pfcmd locationhistoryswitch, 
update your scripts

- lib/pf/vlan.pm interface changed
custom_getNodeInfo() renamed to getNodeUpdatedInfo() and signature changed

- deprecated subs
lib/pf/SNMP.pm's setIsolationVlan, setRegistrationVlan and setNormalVlan are now deprecated and will be removed in the future. Use setVlanByName($ifIndex, $switch_locker_ref, $vlanName) instead. For example: setVlanByName($ifIndex, \%switch_locker, 'guestVlan'); 

- SOAP handler changed
The URI of the SOAP handler changed from http://www.packetfence.org/PFEvents to http://www.packetfence.org/PFAPI. To better reflect the fact that it is not just an event handling server. You will need to upgrade your remote snort probes with the new PacketFence remote snort sensor RPM or manually change the URI.
