2010-06-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Avoiding warnings in unpleasant situations

	* pf/addons/dev-helpers/radius-hook.pl, pf/t/stress-test/radius-calls,
	pf/t/stress-test/soap-calls-radius_authorize, 
	pf/t/stress-test/soap-calls-snort, pf/t/stress-test/soap-server.conf: 
	Added a bunch of scripts to help tests (integration, stress) and devel

	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence_soap.pl: Ported below fix to
	new radius SOAP module.

	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence_sql.pl: Using NAS-IP-Address, a 
	radius standard attribute, instead of Client-IP-Address as the switch IP
	address. Module now works with freeradius2. Fixes #1007;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=1007

2010-06-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm: Refactoring: using constants instead of hardcoded
	string: VOIP

2010-06-01	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	PacketFence 1.9.0-0.20100601 aka PacketFence 1.9.0rc1

2010-05-25	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Fixed bug #833 again using hard-references this time. 
	Tricky perl stuff...

	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Fixed a bug with new node categories where a node
	edit without a category would remove the category.

	* pf/lib/services.pm: Added validation and proper error message on 
	startup when SNMPVersion or SNMPVersionTrap is missing from 
	conf/switches.conf. Fixes #993;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=993

	* pf/t/all.t, pf/t/node.t: Added tests to prevent regressions in subs
	that reads data in pf::node

2010-05-25	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Fixed a bug introduced with new node categories in
	node_view_with_fingerprint.
	
2010-05-18	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Fixed a regression I introduced in revno 
	a7c168dcd6e42180e15dc166feb7167ddc36bc8f in node_modify (pfcmd node 
	edit). Now fixed so its properly updating nodes again.

	* pf/packetfence.spec: A file (conf/floating_network_device.conf) was 
	left out of the RPM spec for Floating Network Device support. This has 
	been fixed.

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Changed other soft-referenced function calls that were
	failing with the updated Parse::RecDescent module.

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Replaced all hard-coded line numbers with __LINE__ perl
	construct since web admin uses a regexp on "line xxx" to be aware about
	errors (as a hack).

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Since yesterday's fix, pfcmd commands need a true 
	return value otherwise pfcmd would report that sub didn't exist. I 
	fixed that.

2010-05-17	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Changed the way we dynamically call pfcmd commands that
	we parsed. Something changed with upstream Parse::RecDescent that 
	cause "Can't coerce GLOB to string" fatal errors under hard to 
	reproduce circumstances. The change should fix them for good. Fixes 
	#833;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=833

2010-05-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/t/pod.t: New type of test that check for pod sections.
	First commit with lots more to do but still in this first test a lot
	of our files fail.

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Merging into trunk required some removal of
	deprecated cleanup calls in sbin/pfsetvlan (db disconnection)

2010-05-07	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/dhcp_fingerprints.conf: New DHCP fingerprints:
	- Ruckus Wireless
	- Ubuntu 9.10
	- a new HP Procurve fingerprint
	- Toshiba Multifunction Printer
	- Xerox

	* pf/conf/oui.txt: Updated oui.txt (MAC address vendors) to latest 
	version (2010-05-07)

	* pf/html/admin/common.php, pf/html/admin/configuration/fingerprint.php:
	Fixed two problems with DHCP fingerprint submissions:
	- if submitted list empty, array_merge error
	- submitting fingerprints via Configuration -> Fingerprint looked like
	  it never worked. Fixed that.

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/report.pm: Fixed a couple of non-working reports. 
	Fixes #984;
	Added test cases for all of pf::pfcmd::report's subs.
	Added Test::NoWarnings as a build dependency.

	version from the RPM spec. Fixes #833;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=833

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Changes to RPM spec file
	- Snapshot vs releases is now defined by an rpmbuild argument
	- source_release should now be passed as an argument to simplify our 
	nightly build system. Fixes #946;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=946

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Fixed a problem with addons/integration-testing
	files in the RPM spec file

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Perl required version is now 5.8.8 since a lot 
	of our source files explictly ask for 5.8.8. Fixes #868;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=868

	* pf/packetfence.spec: perl modules required for testing are now build
	dependencies instead of runtime dependencies. Fixes #866;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=866

2010-05-05	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/installer.pl: The installer now refers to the UPGRADE document
	instead of trying to upgrade the database. Fixes #869;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=869

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan, pf/t/all.t, pf/t/pfsetvlan.t: Now parsing new
	Net-SNMP 5.4 traplog format. Fixes #940;

	that is full of comments.
	Now testing the various traplog format in t/pfsetvlan.t.
	Thanks to Maikel for the report and regexp draft.

	problems with VoIP autodetection. Fixes #896;
	http://www.packetfence.org/bugs/view.php?id=896

	* pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener: Reduced DHCP logging at INFO level. Now we 
	are only logging ACK / OFFER / INFORM and I consolidated fingerprint
	and node modification messages.

	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Fixed a couple of issues with node category 
	support I encountered:
	- One crasher (missing sub because of a bad merge) 
	- Fixed a bug where a missing category would always result in an error
	- Fixed an unnecessary warning on node_modify

2010-05-04	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/ui.conf: Renamed VLAN to Alternate dest. VLAN makes its
	purpose clearer. Fixes #927;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=927

	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Added two paragraph to
	the admin guide under MySQL optimizations: 
	- Avoid 'Too many connections' problems
	- Avoid 'Host <hostname> is blocked' problems
	Fixes #951;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=951

	* pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php, 
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php: VoIPEnabled parameter
	is now a Yes/No dropdown instead of an input text. Fixes #952;
	Also took the opportunity to turn the whole thing into a switch/case
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=952

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Not saying 'Command not understood' anymore if no 
	command was passed to pfcmd. Fixes #972;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=972

	* pf/TODO: dropping TODO in favor of tracking everything in our
	public bugtracker

	* pf/db/pfschema.mysql.188dev, pf/db/upgrade-1.8.6-1.8.8dev.sql,
	pf/db/upgrade-1.9.0-1.10.0.sql, pf/db/pf-schema-1.10.0.sql:
	Databases changes from the feature.rlm-soap branch were on top of 
	1.8.7, since then other changes went in for 1.9.0. I rebased the 
	database changes for feature.rlm-soap on top of 1.9.0. For now,
	targeted at a 1.10.0 release later this year.

	* pf/installer.pl, pf/t/pfcmd.t: New 1.9.0 database hashes

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Now ignoring AUTO_INCREMENT= when calculating database
	hash since this value will always be different for each database.

	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Developers_Guide.odt, 
	pf/docs/PacketFence_Installation_Guide.odt: Mark x86_64 as officially
	supported

2010-05-03	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	and trunk branches. Added small fixes on top of that (whitespace and
	wording)
	- Small corrections. Fixes #950;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=950

2010-04-30	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: VLAN assignment sample for node categorization.

2010-04-23	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/integration-testing/replay-snmptrapd-logs.pl: Created a new
	tool that will be used for load testing / integration testing.

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Added perl(Readonly::XS) as a dependency. 
	Readonly becomes faster with it.

2010-04-20	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/cgi-bin/release.cgi: Added validation in release.cgi and displays

	Fixes #888;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=888

	* pf/lib/pf/services.pm: Improved error-handling with broken switch
	configuration. Fixes #766;
	- switches_conf_is_valid() is now able to tell if the same switch was 
	  specified more than once and will give helpful error message (in 
	  logs/packetfence.log).
	- in generate_snmptrapd_conf() we now avoid bad switch with duplicated 
	  IPs
	- pfsetvlan will start even if errors were detected in switches.conf
	- with test case
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=766

	* pf/html/admin/common.php: Regular expression in web admin has been

	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=885

	* pf/html/admin/status/sajax-dashboard.php: Memory display in the 
	dashboard no longer includes buffers and cache. We were getting too

	its job right. Fixes #916;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=916

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Foundry.pm: Got port security + VoIP to work!

2010-04-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	support doesn't work

2010-04-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/accounting.pl, pf/addons/recovery.pl: hack to make tests
	work successfully in our new build env.

2010-04-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Foundry.pm: Fixed a couple of issues with port-security
	and VLAN changes if ifIndex doesn't change

2010-04-07	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Foundry.pm: Port security implementation

2010-04-06	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Snapshot 1.8.8-0.20100311
	- Added addons/loadMACintoDB.pl to rpm spec

	* pf/conf/pf-release: Version bump to 1.8.8dev (forgot to do earlier)

	* pf/lib/pf/ifoctetslog.pm, pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm: Fixed a context
	issue with database queries related to mac history, switchport history
	and user bandwidth accounting. Also fixed a slight mistake with 
	ifoctet's db queries in general.

2010-04-01	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi: Exception handling in radius authorize so we 
	collect errors in the server logs and in the client logs.
	Also took out CGI::Carp fatalsToBrowser since I've read it's not 
	compatible with mod_perl

2010-03-31	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	Small fixes to issues found during functionnal testing.

	* pf/lib/pf/db.pm: Database is now reconnecting on failed queries

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/ThreeCom/Switch_4200G.pm: Imported bugs and
	limitations section from parent (pf::SNMP::ThreeCom::SS4500).

2010-03-30	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	Lots of small fixes to issues found during functionnal testing.

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Now calling proper 802.1X wired re-authentication
	through pfcmd_vlan
	Also fixed some problems in the parsing of the new traps

	* pf/bin/pfcmd_vlan, pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm: Proper 802.1X re-authentication
	pfcmd_vlan's -deauthenticateDot1x now forces re-authentication on wired
	802.1X if an ifIndex is provided on CLI.
	Generic 802.1X re-authentication was done using standard IEEE8021-PAE
	MIB (oid dot1xPaePortReauthenticate).

2010-03-29	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Moved 
	update_node_if_not_accurate out of locationlog because it something
	that people might need to customized. I changed default behavior not
	to call node_modify if node's VLAN field haven't changed.

2010-03-26	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/t/hardware-snmp-objects.t: fixed some broken tests

	* pf/bin/flip.pl, pf/bin/pfcmd_vlan, 
	pf/docs/MIB/Inverse-PacketFence-Notification.mib, 
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Aruba.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/Catalyst_2960.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/PacketFence.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/lib/pf/radius.pm,
	pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: flip.pl can now handle all Radius connection types
	- modified flip to deal with new connection types
	- added a -deauthenticateDot1x to pfcmd_vlan
	- our local SNMP Traps now carry the connection type (and pfsetvlan 
	  interprets it)
	- Aruba module no longer detects 802.1x on deauth since it's known 
	  when requested now
	- New mechanism to translate NAS-Port to ifIndexes and support for it
	  in the 2960 code
	- pfsetvlan supports new dot1x wireless de-association and issues a 
	  warning on wired dot1x then shut / no shut the port

	* pf/bin/pfcmd,  pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Aruba.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Dlink.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Removed remaining 
	references to hardcoded 'WIFI' ifIndex.

2010-03-24	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/services.pm: PF now creates static routes to routed Vlans 
	when dhcpd is enabled in networks.conf. It used to be when named was 
	enabled.

2010-03-24	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	Minor refactorings all over the place based on review comments

	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: - Graceful recovery if switches.conf is broken
	- Created vlan_determine_for_node and calling the get_xxx_vlan from 
	  pf::vlan
	- Returning radius user is locked return code if vlan_determine_for_node
	  returns -1

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm: Added getVlanByName to resolve VLAN names from 
	switches.conf into VLAN numbers and do appropriate validation and error
	handling. Test case included.

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Refactoring pf::vlan according to review
	- custom_getCorrectVlan renamed to get_normal_vlan
	- Pass node_info hashref instead of individual node information to 
	  get_normal_vlan()
	- Now using the new getVlanByName() call
	- Pushed up the testing of the switch object into 
	  determine_vlan_for_node and we are now degrading gracefully if object
	  is wrong
	- Allowing a -1 return from get_normal_vlan to kick out users
	- get_normal_vlan now takes connection_type and ssid as parameters

	* pf/lib/pf/SwitchFactory.pm: Modified the factory so it can produce
	switches of the 'default' type.

2010-03-23	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Refactoring pf::vlan according to review
	- Extracted get_violation_vlan out of vlan_determine_for_node for 
	future use by pf::radius
	- Removing node_exist()/node_add_simple condition: it never happens
	- Extracted get_registration_vlan out of vlan_determine_for_node for 
	future use by pf::radius. Created test case in t/vlan.t too.

	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: Removed code that I realized was run two times
	for nothing (outlined when I did the tests)

	* pf/t/all.t, pf/t/radius.t: Test for pf::radius

	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: Refactoring pf::radius according to review
	- extracted out VoIP handling into its own sub

2010-03-18	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence_soap.pl, pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi,
	pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: Client - Server SOAP interface changes
	Now passing a tuple with radius return code and radius reply for radius
	rlm client soap call. Allows greater flexibility of radius answers from
	the server side without modifying clients.
	Reworked all validation and returned codes in rlm_perl_packetfence 
	module.
	Little modifications required to server side components so it'll all 
	work.

2010-03-17	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/radius.pm: A big chunk of pf::radius rework and general
	improvements, hopefully really close to tests

	* pf/lib/pf/actions.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: 
	generalized pf::vlan's shouldAutoRegister and getNodeInfoForAutoReg to 
	work with both pfsetvlan and pf::radius
	Changed all callers

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/t/SNMP.t: minor refactoring: extracted code 
	into isManagedVlan() and some tests against it

2010-03-16	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Fix upgrade bug introduced in 1.8.5: Changed
	perl-Locale-gettext dependency to use the perl namespace version 
	perl(Locale-gettext). Fixes #931;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=931

2010-03-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec, pf/t/vlan.t: Updated vlan tests so that rework
	done in 1.8 branch passes the tests. 
	RPM Spec:
	- Added perl-Test-MockModule as a build dependency (required for tests)
	- Test modules are now required for building instead of required for 
	  package install.

2010-03-11	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Snapshot 1.8.8-0.20100311

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/graph.pm, pf/t/all.t, pf/t/graph.t: Fixed problem 
	introduced in the database improvements concerning graphs

	* pf/addons/accounting.pl, pf/addons/recovery.pl, pf/lib/pf/action.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/class.pm, pf/lib/pf/configfile.pm, pf/lib/pf/db.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/ifoctetslog.pm, pf/lib/pf/iplog.pm, pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm,

	pf/sbin/pfmon, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan, pf/t/all.t, pf/t/data.t, 
	pf/t/config.t, pf/t/person.t: Improvements in the database layer
	- new db_query_execute() that handles retrying queries, rebuilding 
	  prepared statements and better error reporting
	- new way to store db handlers, they are now stored in a hash that expose 
	  them per thread
	- use get_db_handle() to get database handle
	- db_connect no longer has a way to force the preparation of statements
	This all means overall use simplification and better error-handling and 
	reporting.

2010-03-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/dashboard.pm, pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/graph.pm,
	pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/report.pm: These files are now a module.

2010-03-05	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Routed VLANs 
	documentation and a schema to explain

	* pf/README_SWITCHES, pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt,
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php, 
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php, pf/t/SNMP.t,

	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: Query optimization (avoid sub-selects)
	Massive improvement of query duration: from a couple of minutes to 
	sub-second on a 25 000 nodes setup.

2010-02-26	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/html/admin/violation/add.php, pf/html/admin/violation/edit.php:
	Fixed a regression where the violation edit page on the web admin would
	not show the violation description properly. Fixes #922;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=922
	Regression introduced in 1.8.4. Cleaning up add.php to use a better
	mechanism to avoid future breakage.

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Fixed validation in custom_getCorrectVlan. I was
	testing against a hashref instead of a switch object. Cleaned up the 
	sub to make the normal case obvious.
	Problem introduced in rev 53a220abaf38f45b6b7f9948dd2d365135354fab.

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/t/SNMP.t: Modified generateFakeMac() to allow

	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=921

	* pf/lib/pf/locationlog.pm, pf/lib/pf/node.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/report.pm: locationlog and node views are now returning
	the human translated connection_type instead of straight from database
	Also took the opportunity to turn report.pm into a real module.

	* pf/html/admin/common.php, pf/lib/pf/config.pm: Changed the long name
	of the SNMP-based connection type.

	* pf/addons/high-availability/pf-diff, 
	pf/addons/high-availability/rdiff: New sync tools that I've been using
	to compare installations

2010-02-25	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	On the road towards radius and traps unification.
	- Major overhaul of the way we think about nodes: two new fields 
	connection_type and voip
	- Updated all affected components
	
2010-02-15	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Cleaning up direct MySQL leftovers
	Removing DBI and pf::db deps
	Removed all manual mysql connections

	* pf/lib/pf/action.pm: Minor refactoring: Extracted action autoreg into
	it's own sub.

2010-02-12	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/action.pm, pf/lib/pf/node.pm, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, 
	pf/sbin/pfsetvlan, pf/t/vlan.t: Refactoring
	Merged the different auto-registration mechanisms into node.pm and 
	vlan.pm out of pfsetvlan.
	Removed duplicated code and raw SQL from pfsetvlan. 
	Massive POD doc and refactoring of vlan.pm.
	Updated associated copyrights.

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Report an error to STDERR if the grammar doesn't
	successfully parse the given command. We also include a line # in the
	output so that it will be shown in the Web admin. Fixes #847;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=847

2010-02-11	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Avoided duplicated code, 
	renamed vlan.pm's custom_getNodeInfo to getNodeUpdatedInfo and modified
	it.

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/pfcmd.pm: Allow ! in value field when quoted. Fixes
	#911;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=911

2010-02-10	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22,
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.pre_apache22: Fixed an apache rewrite rule

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Added validation to custom_getCorrectVlan.
	If the switch object is not correct, return the default VLAN and log a 
	warning.

2010-02-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/recovery.pl, pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm, 
	pf/sbin/pfsetvlan, pf/UPGRADE: Avoid loading the entire SwitchFactory 
	at several spots in vlan.pm by passing the switch object around instead 
	of the switch's IP. Improves performance. Fixes #910;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=910

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm, pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: When a 'UP' trap is received
	PacketFence will try to get the MAC address 30 times or for 2 minutes 
	whichever condition is first met. Fixes #903;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=903
	
	This prevent the following condition: telnet timeouts take three 
	minutes for the thread to recover so 30 times 3 minutes would hang a 
	thread (and the switch) for 90 minutes. Now since it's longer than the 2
	minutes limit, it only hang it for 3 minutes.

	* pf/lib/pf/web.pm: In web_node_record_user_agent call node_modify() 
	directly instead of pfcmd node edit. It's more performant (avoids 
	spawning a shell) and it'll avoid trying to adjust vlan. Fixes #908;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=908

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Created an ALRM signal handler that report an
	error and does nothing else. This is a workaround to prevent pfsetvlan
	to crash when a Net::Telnet or a Net::Appliance::Session call times out,
	sending a SIGALRM. Fixes #907;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=907 

	Upstream bug: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=54415

	Local bug to track upstream: 
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=902

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm: Added a noSuchObject test to 
	isLearntTrapsEnabled

	the popups without checking return status. Fixes #899;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=899

2010-02-01	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	Documented an issue with Windows 7 and certain IOSes

2010-01-28	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	the base switch module contract and we often don't know what's expected
	when we re-implement subs

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/ISR_1800.pm: getVlan was returning true or false
	instead of requested VLAN, now fixed

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/ISR_1800.pm: More work to support ISR1800 series
	- Implemented getMacBridgePortHash and it relies on CLI :(
	- Implemented _getAllIfIndexForThisVlan (used by getMacBridgePortHash)
	- Added mandatory POD sections

2010-01-27	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco/ISR_1800.pm: Implemented isDefinedVlan and
	getVlan for the ISR 1800

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm: Added POD doc

2010-01-26	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Installation_Guide.odt: Default web admin
	account is not admin / qwerty anymore, it is defined by user when
	running installer.pl. Corrected that mistake in the install guide.

2010-01-22	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Validate for successful write to conf/switches.conf 
	when adding, deleting and editing a switch. Fixes #898;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=898

	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22: Windows Proxy autoconfiguration 
	gets a forbidden on captive portal (reduce load)

2009-12-10	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/web.pm: We no longer bindly accept someone who is 
	authenticated based on session information. In effect, this prevents
	users from re-registering without entering username / password again.
	Fixes #761;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=761

2009-12-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Aruba.pm: 802.1x deauthentication support and

	successfully and if pfdetect can bind to it

	* Copied pf/conf/templates/snort.conf to 
	pf/conf/templates/snort.conf.pre_snort-2.8
	Modified pf/conf/templates/snort.conf, pf/lib/pf/services.pm: snort

	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=853
	
	* pf/lib/pf/node.pm: commented code

2009-11-16	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

2009-11-10	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php: 
	* pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php: Fixed issues with SSH
	for CLI transport. Should be set to 'SSH' rather than 'ssh'

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Fixed issues with desAssociate trap for Wireless.
	Threads don't support SSH CLI transport mode. So we fork a call to 
	'pfcmd_vlan -deauthenticate ...'

2009-11-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl: Rewrite of our freeradius
	802.1x perl module. Resolving problems with guests (visitors) and 
	registered users in secure SSID. Fixes 839, 841;
	Also, VISITOR is now called GUEST and improved documentation while I 
	was at it.
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=839
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=841

	* pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_add.php,
	pf/html/admin/configuration/switches_edit.php: Fixed typo in switch
	definition in the Web Admin causing problems adding or editing a Cisco

	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=836

2009-11-02	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/services.pm: Fixed missing library requirement when using
	PacketFence with routed VLANs

2009-11-02	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/html/admin/node/lookup.php, pf/lib/pf/lookup/node.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/help.pm: Node lookup now gives information about IP
	and DHCP status (from iplog)
	Updated pfcmd's help
	Output in Web Admin is no longer right-aligned

	longer case-sensitive. Fixes #831;
	http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=831

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: performance: verifying if violation already 
	exists in violation_trigger. Improves performance in situation where 
	there are a lot of devices repetively generating violation (ex: blocked
	iPods) because we detect it before launching `pfcmd violation add`.
	Also decreased logging prority from WARN to INFO

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Tighter validation in violation_trigger when
	database query returns a non-empty array (which is a bigger problem yet
	to be identified)

2009-10-27	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Decided to get rid of
	the release notes section (avoids manual data duplication)
	Added a pointer to NEWS, UPGRADE and ChangeLog in "About this guide"
	section.

	http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=757
	Reported by Josh Ward (he also suggested the fix) Many thanks!

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Parse::RecDescent is a build dependency AND a 
	runtime one. Hopefully fixes #806 for good;
	http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=806

	* pf/packetfence.spec, pf/installer.pl: Packaging and installer fixes
	- Parse::RecDescent is a build dependency not a runtime one. Fixes #806;
	  http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=806
	- Pulling php-pear-Log instead of php-pear. Fixes #804
	  http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=804
	- jpgraph is no longer installed by installer.pl (is a dep of the rpm)
	- php-pear-Log is no longer installed by installer
	- Lots of new TODO task for installer

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/pfcmd.pm: Removed use of Log::Log4perl
	This removes a lot of unnecessary build requirements and it wasn't even
	used anywhere in this file. Fixes #826;
	http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=826

	* pf/packetfence.spec: Added dependency to enable SNMPv3 AES encryption
	support. Fixes #775; http://packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=775

	* pf/conf/documentation.conf, pf/conf/pf.conf.defaults: Clarified 
	Nessus Scan parameters

	scans from the web admin and made the result page the default page when
	clicking on the scan tab

	* Added pf/html/user/content/templates/scan-in-progress.html.
	* Modified pf/cgi-bin/redir.cgi, pf/cgi-bin/release.cgi, 
	pf/conf/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/packetfence.po, 
	pf/conf/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/packetfence.po, pf/lib/pf/scan.pm, 
	pf/lib/pf/web.pm: Nessus scan integration
	- Tracking the state of registration scans
	- New "scan in progress" page
	- redir.cgi and release.cgi will redirect to the new scan in progress
	  page if a scan is in progress
	- Not showing Nessus server's password in the logs anymore
	- Scanning page now redirect once the progress bar is over

2009-10-22	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/cgi-bin/release.cgi, pf/conf/documentation.conf, 
	pf/conf/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/packetfence.po, 
	pf/conf/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/packetfence.po, pf/conf/pf.conf.defaults,
	pf/lib/pf/config.pm, pf/lib/pf/web.pm: Nessus scan integration
	- Forking in the background when calling a scan to pfcmd and redirecting
	  to a scan in progress page
	- New parameter scan.duration to control the length of the scan progress
	  bar
	- French and English translations of the new scan in progress page
	- New generate_scan_progress_page() in lib/pf/web.pm

	* pf/cgi-bin/release.cgi: Removed vid hack for Nessus scan violation

	* pf/lib/pf/trigger.pm: Removed deprecated code: trigger_scan and 
	trigger_scan_add subs

	* pf/lib/pf/scan.pm: Scan using violation_trigger mechanism now
	Also moved IP to MAC test earlier and quit if it can't resolve

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Preparing violation_trigger to handle scan 
	violations
	- new test: scan violation id not authorized in config
	- took out of the trigger id loop various one time tests (inefficient)
	- violation trigger returns 1 if at least one violation is added 0 
	  otherwise
	- bonus POD doc

	* pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi, pf/sbin/pfdetect: Fixed trappable ip test to add
	a violation.

2009-10-21	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/sbin/pfdetect: pfdetect now sends IP when calling violation_trigger
	since the information is already available to it anyway

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Using $bin_dir instead of hardcoded path
	to call pfcmd. Closes a TODO task.

	* pf/lib/pf/scan.pm, pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/lib/pf/trigger.pm: Refactoring
	Moved all scanning code out of pfcmd into a new scan module

	* pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/lib/pf/schedule.pm: Nessus scan integration
	Removed all references of trigger id (tid) regarding scanning

	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/help.pm: pfcmd schedule documentation now accurate

	* pf/bin/pfcmd, pf/cgi-bin/release.cgi, pf/html/admin/scan/scan.php:
	Nessus Scan integration
	No more special scans with tid=99999 carrying a special meaning. All
	scanning is done with command line nessus client instead of 
	Nessus::ScanLite (which lacked plugin configuration capabilities). Other
	fixes includes:
	- Removing the 1200001 violation only if one exists (fix a problem when
	  scanning from Web admin)
	- Set HOME= env before calling nessus to conf/nessus/ so the .nessusrc 
	  file is created at a location accessible from CLI and web interfaces
	- Capturing the output of the nessus call and logging it if nessus 
	  returns a non-zero exit code
	- trigger_scan is deprecated
	- Updated web admin accordingly and explicitly disabled scheduled scans

2009-10-20	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/802.1X/pfcmd_ap.pl: Deleted
	* pf/addons/802.1X/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl, pf/addons/802.1X/README:
	Performance improvement in the freeradius PacketFence module
	Merged the content of pfcmd_ap.pl into rlm_perl_packetfence.pl. This 
	avoids costly forks for each radius request.
	Also took the opportunity to add validation of the db handle.

2009-10-19	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/UPGRADE, pf/NEWS: Updated NEWS and UPGRADE with all the work done
	since 1.8.4

2009-10-16	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Improved error-handling in violation_trigger
	Reverted fix in revision 5abfb5911a05dc03e9646eb79a48653155e39278
	because it was too convoluted and replaced it with something clearer.

	* pf/conf/violations.conf: Working Nessus config sample

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Work torwards Nessus integration
	pfcmd now handles by itself the fact that it needs to close the 
	system scan violation if the scan was successfull

	* pf/lib/pf/action.pm, pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Slight logging changes to
	better represent what is actually going on.

	* pf/lib/pf/trigger.pm: trigger_add_scan now follows a contract: returns
	1 if a violation was added by the trigger and 0 otherwise
	a litle POD doc as a bonus

2009-10-16      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/conf/ui.conf:
	* pf/bin/pfcmd:
	* pf/lib/pf/pfcmd/pfcmd.pm:
	* pf/lib/pf/services.pm: Added the pf_gateway field in networks.conf 
	used to store the PacketFence gateway for a routed VLAN. This is field 
	is only used with routed Registration and Isolation VLANs.
	Added code to allow PacketFence to dynamically create static routes for
	routed Registration and Isolation VLANs. We use the pf_gateway field.

2009-10-16      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Added a fix to show a message when trying to delete a 
	node having open locationlog entries. Fixes #807
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=807

2009-10-15      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>

2009-10-15      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: "violation not added, no trigger found for.."
	messages too noisy in logs so we decreased log level from INFO to 
	DEBUG. Fixes #812
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=812

	and log an error. Fixes #755 and #813
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=755
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=813 

2009-10-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/cgi-bin/redir.cgi: Logging improvement in redir.cgi
	Messages and log priority makes more sense now

2009-10-13	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Increased logging severity for the "Can't
	determine Uplinks for the switch" message (from info to warn).
	The problem is that at this point nothing gets done by packetfence so
	it is rather important to see this message.

	* pf/conf/violations.conf: Added a new UserAgent statement to block
	PSPs

2009-10-13      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.init: Added test in condrestart to check if 
	pfsetvlan.pid exists. If so, restart packetfence. Fixes #805;

2009-10-13      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/packetfence.spec: Added new dependencies on
	- perl-LDAP (used to authenticate users trough LDAP during registration)
	- php-ldap (used to authenticate users connecting to the Web interface 
	through LDAP)
	- perl-IPC-Cmd (used to generate static routes for registration and 
	isolation routed VLANs)
	- perl-SOAP-Lite (used when receiving alerts from Snort)
	Fixes #798;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=798
	- seting the perl-parse-RecDescent version to 1.94 in order to avoid 
	issues with the newer versions that causes the pfcmd_pregrammar.pm 
	generation to fail. Fixes #806;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=806

2009-10-13	Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/addons/pfcmd_ap.pl: In order to avoid unnecessary WIFI entries in
	locationlog (since authentication->reauthentication occurs very often), 
	we don't add new entries anymore if there is already one.i Fixes #788
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=788

2009-10-13	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Updated configuration

	PlayStation Portable (PSP)

2009-10-09      Regis Balzard <rbalzard@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Removed isClientAlive() since we remove the Hub 
	violation that creates too many false positives. 
	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: Removed calls to isClientAlive().
	* pf/conf/violations.conf: Removed Hub violation definition.
	* pf/html/user/content/violations/hub.php: Removed this file.
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Cisco.pm: Removed the parsing of c2900AddressViolation
	traps which only purpose what to generate Hub violations.

2009-10-09	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/web.pm: Changed priority of unknown User-Agent log message
	Was WARN is now INFO which is less scary and makes a lot more sense. 

	* pf/conf/documentation.conf, pf/conf/pf.conf.defaults: Documentation
	for the whitelist parameter is now more accurate.
	
	* pf/cgi-bin/pdp.cgi, pf/lib/pf/violation.pm, pf/sbin/pfdetect,
	pf/sbin/pfdhcplistener: The validation that the violation is applicable
	is now done in violation_trigger removing duplicate code. Fixes #801;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=801

2009-10-08	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/rawip.pm, pf/lib/pf/util.pm, pf/sbin/pfmon: Testing for 
	whitelisted_mac is no longer called inside trappable_mac sub.
	Modified callers so they do the test themselves.
	Whitelisting validation was called two times because of that.

	* pf/lib/pf/util.pm: Removed commented code

2009-10-06	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Enterasys/D2.pm, pf/README_SWITCHES: Added support for
	Enterasys Standalone D2 Switch

	Added instructions to setup the D2
	Updated supported switches list

2009-10-05	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Linksys.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Nortel.pm, pf/lib/pf/SNMP.pm:
	Various getUpLinks() subs didn't respect the "return -1 on failure" 
	contract. Fixes #795;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=795

	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22,
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.pre_apache22: Fixed the omission of a banned

	* Added pf/addons/high-availability/dhcpd-3.0.5-init-script-lsb-fix.patch:
	Little patch to fix LSB compliance of dhcpd's init script. 
	Non-compliant init scripts generate scary error messages in Heartbeat.

	#771;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=771

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Enterasys/SecureStack_C3.pm, pf/README_SWITCHES: Added
	support for Enterasys SecureStack C3 Switch

	setup the SecureStack C3
	Updated supported switches list
	Added comments about cleanup to do
	Minor formatting / whitespace cleanup

	pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: Added support for
	Enterasys Matrix N3 Switch (Chassis)
	It works in linkUp/linkDown mode and port-security (called maclock on
	Enterasys hardware). Talks to the switch using SNMP.
	Documentation on how to configure was added to the admin guide.

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Enterasys.pm: Fix for maclock support (Enterasys' port
	security): Trap string had a typo in parseTrap()

	* pf/bin/pfcmd: Fixed a typo in a comment

	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Administration_Guide.odt: New switch config
	Added configuration information for SMC TigerStack 6224M. Thanks to
	Chinasee B. <chinasee.b@psu.ac.th> who provided his config.

	* pf/lib/pf/violation.pm: Crash fix
	If we attempted to trigger a violation but no trigger for the violation
	existed, we still tried to move on and add the violation which caused
	the use of a 0 in an hash reference thus a crash.

	* pf/lib/pf/vlan.pm: Fix a crash that happens if violation classes are
	corrupted and a vlan change is required (like when a violation is
	created)

	* Renamed pf/addons/high-availability/named-init-script-lsb-fix.patch
	to pf/addons/high-availability/named-9.2-init-script-lsb-fix.patch:
	bind 9.2 exposed wrong behavior but bind 9.3 is fine and patch doesn't
	apply anyway

2009-09-14	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>

	* pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.apache22 and 
	pf/conf/templates/httpd.conf.pre_apache22: Block misbehaving User Agents
	Block at the apache level some User Agents that we don't care about
	such as Windows Update, etc. We give them a 403 error (forbidden).
	Fixes bug #790;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=790

	* pf/lib/pf/SNMP/Linksys.pm: Deactivated port security on Linksys
	Known to be broken and the telnet code was sending SIGALRM and crashing
	pfsetvlan.
	Also added some trace level logging statements. Fixes bug #797;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=797

	* pf/sbin/pfsetvlan: pfsetvlan stops on SIGALRM signal
	Die is properly sent to log4perl. No more misterious stops without any
	error. Alarm signals are known to be buggy with threaded perl. Fixes 
	bug #796;
	http://www.packetfence.org/mantis/view.php?id=796

2009-08-25	Olivier Bilodeau <obilodeau@inverse.ca>
	* pf/docs/PacketFence_Installation_Guide.odt: Install Guide updated
	Details
	- version bump
	- yum update before rpmforge install
	- removed priorities requirement (not sure about this one)
	- updated installation procedure to reflect new yum repo
	- re-generated ToC so that updating the table works with OpenOffice 3.1
	- added index links to the ToC elements, it now creates a linkified PDF
	- switch setup now points to the Admin Guide for more switch config
	samples and supported devices list
	- re-org: switches definition before custom trap handling functions 
	since pf's new behavior is based on switch definition rather than 
	per-node
	- explained new correctVlan behavior
	- modifed switches definition to outline the fact that vlan number can
	be overloaded in a specific switch from the default
	- some minor prettification
	- mentionned new support packages and added meat in commecial support 
	section
