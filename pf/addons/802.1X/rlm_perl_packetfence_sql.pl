# registered, normal user, secure, violation     => VLAN per violation
# registered, normal user, secure, no violation  => normal VLAN
# registered, normal user, non-secure            => disconnect (-1)
# not-registered, secure                         => disconnect (-1)
# not-registered, non-secure, violation          => disconnect (-1)*
# not-registered, non-secure, no violation       => registration VLAN
#
# *: We disconnect here because if the violation VLAN is a VLAN that is unavailable on the
#    non-secure SSID, the device will be in a connect loop. But if we return -1 the device 
#    stop trying to connect.
#    This breaks Nessus Scans on registration (since they generate a special violation) you
#    might want to change this behaviour in that case.
#    Keep in mind that the underlying problem is that you can't have a the same VLAN Id on
#    both the secure and non-secure SSID.
